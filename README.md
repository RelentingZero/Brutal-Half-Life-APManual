# Brutal-Half-Life-APManual
A project to add Archipelago Manual support for the Brutal Half-Life mod for the original Half-Life

# Before You Start
Before you download please note the following:
- This mod requires the Brutal Half-Life mod available here: https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-half-life if you do not have this mod, check locations will not line up properly and you WILL encounter issues. This manual WILL NOT work with base Half-Life.
- This is a MANUAL, not an actual AP implementation, please be familiar with AP Manuals before downloading
- Reuse is fine as long as proper credit is given

# What this is
This is a manual for Brutal Half-Life for use in Archipelago Multiworlds. This has been developed by me in my spare time as a passion project.

# Major Checks:
-Scripted Setpieces
-Health and H.E.V. Stations
-Major Weapon Pickups

# Goal:
Beat Gonarch and Nihilanth
